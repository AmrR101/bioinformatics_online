# Introduction

This page is our effort (Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core or HBC) to curate training content available online for bench biologists who want to learn bioinformatics. We have divided the content between general resources and content specific resources.

*We created this list with help from many sources and conversations on Twitter. This list is not complete and we are thinking about this as a work in progress. We gratefully welcome all suggestions for expanding the list, so please update and create a pull request or [email us](mailto:hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu) with suggestions!*
