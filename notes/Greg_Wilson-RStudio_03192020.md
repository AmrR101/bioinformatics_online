**Greg Wilson, RStudio - 3/19/2020**

* DONT CHANGE WHAT YOU DONT HAVE TO!!

* quoted elizabeth wickes about NOT ASSUMING - ask people

* Dont try to be or beat recorded video! (It requires time and money.)

	* interactive methods are okay
	* if ignoring this "A pattern Language for Screencasting" - Chen and Rabb

* Don't worry about making mistakes

	* "Learn the song, then improvise over it"

* Really hard to teach to empty chairs

	* don't do this?
	* have some folks turn on their video, invite about 6 people, ask questions and look to them for answers
	* Give people a way to opt out
	* tell then it is being recorded (if recording) 
	* Greg prefers Zoom

* Give a tour at the start, i.e. how to use the tools

	* generate instructions when logged in as a user (non-host)

* Direct traffic, a lot of verbal cues

	* where do things go?
	* /hand when they want to speak
	* lots of directions verbally (even if they are written out)
	* conventions for a given workshop provider might be different so clear instructions are appreciated

* "Mute all" and have people raise hands to speak.

	* Maybe have a written list of names of people in the class
	* put a tick mark against all the people interacting, and give preference to people who have not spoken before

* Call on people by name

	* give them the option of not having an answer
	* learning diversity could possibly be evened out
	* harder questions for faster students.
	* Make sure extroverts don't take over the answering

* Don't teach alone

* Do a dry run with your copilot

	* firewalls for data access
	* zoom controls have changed
	* 30 minutes for set up and with other instructors

* Have your notes beside you to avoid unflattering and distracting video

* Give notes to students (we are set with our lessons)

* Use accesibility tools for eveyone

	* make cursor larger - mac has the option
	* use high-contrast mode (where?)
	* Keycasting mode (?) - keycasters

* Teach from your smallest screen

	* RStudio IDE is especially hard - going down to one panel frees up real estate but your screen no longer looks like theirs

* Your voice matters more than your face!

	* get your mic away from your keyboard (about 30cms away from your mouth)
	* get a stand?
	* get a mic?

* Turn off ALL your notifications!!

	* minimize the dock and any bouncing action
	* ask participants to turn off their notifications

* Share work in real time

	* HackMD or GoogleDoc with edit permission for students
	* ask students to paste code into the doc or the chat
	* everytime you ask a question, paste their names into the doc so they know where to type/paste
	* Google doc can only have 12-14 simultaneous typists so switch up everytime

* Ask-fill-call

	* Thinking takes time
	* give students time to answer
	* fill the time when they are thinking with some related thing
	* then call upon the person to give you their answer

* Ask for predictions?
	* Tell me in the chat, how will this change in the code affect the result/output?
	* gives a very good formative assessment - realtime feedback 

* Use breakout rooms

	* screensharing not available in breakout rooms 

* Don't use the Zoom Whiteboard yet, first get used to the online teaching

* Take a break every hour!

	* set a timer for 45, gives you 15 minutes to find a good stopping point

* Many people are doing this for the first time!!!

	* Okay to suck - it's a first step

* Don't be afraid to experiment

	* audience will likely be very understanding

* Brookfield and Preskill "The Discussion Book"

* Ask people how they want to be addressed? When? Ask people what pronoun they prefer.

* Over the class period, introduce new technologies, e.g. Zoom first, then later google doc, poll everywhere?
