In this document we will lay out guidelines for various aspects of teaching online, and have categorized the guidelines keeping in mind the timeline of a workshop.

## Setting up prior to workshop

* Designate roles - at least 3 instructors needed for smooth sailing and the roles are listed below. These roles will rotate among the 3 people during the workshop.  
     1. **Presenter**
     1. **Meeting Controller** (Host/co-hosts) - Host starts the meeting with designated co-host(s). They with full control of the Zoom Meeting to enable muting/unmuting participants, solve any technical problems, create breakout rooms. 
     1. **Troubleshooter** - Checks the Chat and PollEverywhere for technical questions from participants and is on call to help participants troubleshoot. This trouble shooting can be triaged, with more involved problems set aside for end of section to enable the presenter to step in and help. More about triaging in the "[During Class](during-class)" section.

* Meeting Host will set up Zoom with the following settings:
  * Do not use personal room ID to start meeting or to share with participants
  * Disable “Join Before Host”
  * Enable and assign co-hosts
  * Disable “File Transfer”
  * Disable “Allow Removed Participants to Rejoin”
  * Mute all participants
  * Disable students to send chat to everyone
  * Allow only host to share screen 
  * In share screen setting, uncheck first box (enter full screen). May need all students to do this.
  * Do not allow participants to record.
  * Switch Host role to Troubleshooter so that Troubleshooter can enter any breakout room.

* As a Presenter (or anyone sharing their screens), make sure computer is set up appropriately:
  * Quit all applications that are not required for class, especially if they generate notifications
  * If on a Mac, make sure your dock is hidden, this creates real estate for the windows that you are sharing and is not distracting
  * Use an external mic if possible and make sure it is close to your mouth but away from the keyboard (to the best of your ability)
  * If using an external microphone or speaker, be sure to select that microphone or speaker in Zoom to use.
  
* As the Troubleshooter:
  * Change name to 'Troubleshooter' so that students know who to DM for help.

## First contact with learners

* Go over learner instructions in this repo
* Lead learners through practicing raising their hands
* When presenter asks questions of learners, ask learners to either use red and green stickies or raise hands
* Inform participants to direct message the ‘Troubleshooter’ if they need any help, and they will be able to DM you, and if necessary to join your breakout room and privately talk with you.
* Create breakout rooms and instruct everyone to press ‘Later’. Ensure no one joined the breakout rooms, and if they did, let them know that they can exit by clicking on the 'Leave breakout room' in the lower right hand corner of the zoom screen.
* Inform participants to raise hands if they have a conceptual question for the presenter or to add question to PollEverywhere if the question can wait until the end of the session
* Introduce PollEverywhere as the place to ask questions and upvote others' questions
* Briefly explain triaging and that presenter will be mostly addressing questions at the end
* Explain the additional breaks in the schedule
* Display the screen set-up if requiring multiple windows to be open.
     - Examples: 
          - Teaching R with RStudio:
               * Presenter: left-hand half of screen completely from top to bottom with RStudio and right-hand half is materials covering environment and help.
               * Learners: Zoom screen in upper left two-thirds of screen, RStudio in lower right two-thirds of screen, and materials on the right half side behind RStudio.
          - Teaching shell:          
               * Presenter: left-hand half of screen with shell and right-hand half is materials.
               * Learner: left-hand half of screen with shell and right-hand half is materials.
          

## During class

* Presenters
     * Wait for a little longer than usual for learners to respond
     * Don't worry if you slip up, correct yourself and restart
     * Ask for help from the other instructors and focus on teaching
     * When asking questions of learners, ask learners to either use red and green stickies or raise hands.
     * Unmute a learner if requesting a direct answer.
     * Don't need to stop for raised hands, but can if desired.  
     * Make sure the font is big enough to see. In sharing mode, font size tends to be smaller.
     * Possible to use polls between sessions for assessment, but not for in-session assessment.
     * Controller and troubleshooter may jump in to clarify or add on.
     * Controller will ask any appropriate PollEverywhere questions at the end of the session.
     * At transition, stop screen share, and save any shared data (RData) off screen for next presenter to load. Inform next presenter when data is finished saving.

* Controller
     * Mute and unmute learners as requested by presenter
     * Monitor for technical difficulties
     * Ask appropriate PollEverywhere questions of presenter at end of session
     * Watch the "thumbs up" (green stickies) and "thumbs down" (red stickies) icon in the participant list to help presenter assess if they need to re-explain something, slow down.
     * Help the troubleshooter with questions from class (use your judgement to prioritize this over monitoring) through direct message, but never enter breakout room so that can continue monitoring the class.
     * Avoid students sending message in the chat room (it will notify everyone, and is disruptive). Only allow them to send private message to troubleshooter.
     * Initiate a quick survey after 1st session, and ask students what technical problem they encountered.
     * Take a break at least every one hour
     * Inform class of transitions, and that class will meet back in 5-10 min. Use closed captioning to write out that we are on break for 5-10 minutes.

* Troubleshooter 
     * Watch Zoom Chat or PollEverywhere for questions and categorize them into 3 groups.
          1. If conceptual, encourage them to ask in PollEverywhere or raise hand when presenter asks for questions.
          2. Answer technical questions in a DM if you are able and don't think the class will benefit from the question
     * Zoom breakout room specifics:
          3. If absolutely need to discuss the question with the learner, then join learner-specific breakout room. Try to resolve by DM first though. Make sure that we solve all questions for each session before moving forward with the next session. 
     * Ask Controller for help if needed
     * Ask Presenter to stop or slow down as needed based on influx of technical questions

## Wrapping up

* Finish modified post-class survey

## Follow up after class
