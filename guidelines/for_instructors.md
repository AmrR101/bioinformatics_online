In this document we will lay out guidelines for various aspects of teaching online, and have categorized the guidelines keeping in mind the timeline of a workshop.

#### [Instructor] Setting up prior to workshop

* Designate roles - at least 3 instructors needed for smooth sailing and the roles are listed below. These roles will rotate among the 3 people during the workshop.  
     1 **Presenter**
     1 **Meeting Controller** (Host/co-hosts) - Host starts the meeting with designated co-host(s). They with full control of the Zoom Meeting to enable muting/unmuting participants, solve any technical problems, create breakout rooms. 
     1 **Troubleshooter** - Checks the Chat and PollEverywhere for questions from participants and is on call to help participants troubleshoot. This trouble shooting can be triaged, with more involved problems set aside for end of section to enable the presenter to step in and help. More about triaging in the "[During Class](during-class)" section.

* Meeting Host will set up Zoom with the following settings:
  * Disable “Join Before Host”
  * Enable and assign co-hosts
  * Disable “File Transfer”
  * Disable “Allow Removed Participants to Rejoin”

* As a Presenter (or anyone sharing their screens), please make sure your computer is set up appropriately:
  * Quit all applications that are not required for class, especially if they generate notifications
  * If on a Mac, make sure your dock is hidden, this creates real estate for the windows that you are sharing and is not distracting
  * Use an external mic if possible and make sure it is close to your mouth but away from the keyboard (to the best of your ability)



#### [Instructor] First contact with learners

* Go over learner instructions in this repo
* Introduce PollEverywhere as the place to ask questions and upvote others' questions
* Briefly explain triaging and that presenter will be mostly addressing questions at the end
* Explain the additional breaks in the schedule
