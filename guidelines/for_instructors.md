In this document we will lay out guidelines for various aspects of teaching online, and have categorized the guidelines keeping in mind the timeline of a workshop.

#### [Instructor] Setting up prior to workshop

* Host will set up Zoom with the following settings:
  * Disable “Join Before Host” so people can't cause trouble before you arrive
  * Enabling “Co-Host” so you can assign others to help moderate
  * Disable “File Transfer” so there's no digital virus sharing
  * Disable “Allow Removed Participants to Rejoin” so booted attendees can't slip back in

* Designate roles
  * at least 3 instructors needed for smooth sailing - presenter, meeting controller (host/co-host) and troubleshooter. These roles will rotate among the 3 people during the workshop.  
     * **Presenter**
     * **Meeting Controller** - Host starts the meeting with designated co-host(s). They with full control of the Zoom Meeting to enable muting/unmuting participants, solve any technical problems, create breakout rooms. 
     * **Troubleshooter** - Checks the Chat and PollEverywhere for questions from participants and is on call to help participants troubleshoot. This trouble shooting can be triaged, with more involved problems set aside for end of section to enable the presenter to step in and help. More about triaging in the "[During Class](during-class)" section.

#### [Instructor] First contact with learners

* Go over learner instructions in this repo
* Introduce PollEverywhere as the place to ask questions and upvote others' questions
* Briefly explain triaging and that presenter will be mostly addressing questions at the end
* Explain the additional breaks in the schedule
