In this document we will lay out guidelines for various aspects of teaching online, and have categorized the guidelines keeping in mind the timeline of a workshop.

## Setting up prior to workshop

* Designate roles - at least 3 instructors needed for smooth sailing and the roles are listed below. These roles will rotate among the 3 people during the workshop.  
     1. **Presenter**
     1. **Meeting Controller** (Host/co-hosts) - Host starts the meeting with designated co-host(s). They with full control of the Zoom Meeting to enable muting/unmuting participants, solve any technical problems, create breakout rooms. 
     1. **Troubleshooter** - Checks the Chat and PollEverywhere for questions from participants and is on call to help participants troubleshoot. This trouble shooting can be triaged, with more involved problems set aside for end of section to enable the presenter to step in and help. More about triaging in the "[During Class](during-class)" section.

* Meeting Host will set up Zoom with the following settings:
  * Disable “Join Before Host”
  * Enable and assign co-hosts
  * Disable “File Transfer”
  * Disable “Allow Removed Participants to Rejoin”
  * Mute all participants

* As a Presenter (or anyone sharing their screens), please make sure your computer is set up appropriately:
  * Quit all applications that are not required for class, especially if they generate notifications
  * If on a Mac, make sure your dock is hidden, this creates real estate for the windows that you are sharing and is not distracting
  * Use an external mic if possible and make sure it is close to your mouth but away from the keyboard (to the best of your ability)
  * Install and use [keycastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) so learners can see the keyboard keys being used by the instructor.

## First contact with learners

* Go over learner instructions in this repo
* Introduce PollEverywhere as the place to ask questions and upvote others' questions
* Briefly explain triaging and that presenter will be mostly addressing questions at the end
* Explain the additional breaks in the schedule
* Point out the output of keycastr

## During class

* Presenters
     * Wait for a little longer than usual for learners to respond
     * Ask for a few learners to turn their videos on so you are not teaching to a screen
     * Don't worry if you slip up, correct yourself and restart
     * Ask for help from the other instructors and focus on teaching
* Meeting-controllers
     * Mute and unmute learners as requested by presenter
     * Monitor for technical difficulties
     * Watch the "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" icon in the participant list to help presenter assess if they need to re-explain something, slow down.
     * Help the troubleshooter with questions from class (use your judgement to prioritize this over monitoring)
* Troubleshooter 
     * Watch Zoom Chat or PollEverywhere for questions and categorize them into 3 groups.
          1. Save some for end of class (feel free to summarize) 
          1. Give some to presenter when she/he asks for questions (feel free to summarize)
          1. Answer them in a DM if you are able to help in 1-2 minutes and don't think the class will benefit from the question
     * Ask Meeting controller for help if needed
     * Ask Presenter to stop or slow down as needed based on influx of questions
