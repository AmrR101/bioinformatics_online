# Guidelines for learners

These guidelines are for learners taking a hands-on workshop online with the [Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu)

### Setting up prior to workshop

* Quit/minimize all applications that are not required for class
* Download all required packages and install all required applications
  * Email the HBC Training Team if any of the downloads/installations are problematic
* Check sound quality on laptop and use headphones if possible
* If a dual monitor is accessible, then this could be quite helpful, though definitely not necessary

**Zoom Meeting**

We will be using Zoom for the workshop, and a Zoom account is NOT needed to join. We will provide a URL that can be used to join the classroom/meeting with a web browser or with the Zoom app. 
* If you are **using the Zoom app** downloaded, make sure to select the "Open zoom.us" option at launch to open the Zoom app

  * Cross mark (equivalent to a red post-it) - "disagree", "I need help", "unsure"
  <img src="img/.png" width="500">

* Make sure you are muted during the workshop (the meeting host will do this, if you don't). The meeting host will unmute you as needed.

* Video is optional and it is up to you if you keep it on or off.

* Set up your windows to best follow the workshop. You will have 3 windows open, (1) Zoom, (2) Class lessons and (3) RStudio or Terminal. See below for an example
   * Example: Zoom screen in upper left two-thirds of screen, RStudio in lower right two-thirds of screen, and materials on the right half side behind RStudio.

### During the workshop

#### Following along

* **Always have the workshop materials open**, and if you fall behind, you can catch up by following the materials. If unable to catch up on your own, you can direct message the Troubleshooter.

* **If Zoom gets disconnected**, just use the same meeting link used to connect initially to re-connect. Use the workshop materials to catch up, and, if unable to catch up on your own, direct message the Troubleshooter.

* **Do not share your screen**, unless an instructor asks you to share for troubleshooting purposes.

#### Questions

* **Presenter questions:** The Presenter will ask questions of the learners throughout the workshop and will ask for responses via red/green stickies or raised hands. Presenter may call on those with green stickies to provide answers or those with red or no stickies to determine any problems.

* **Technical learner questions:** Direct message the person labelled as 'Troubleshooter' with a description of the problem. Troubleshooter may be able to solve problem through direct message, but may ask you to join a breakout room to discuss in person, if necessary.

* **Conceptual learner questions:** 
  - When the Presenter asks for questions, then you can raise hand and instructor may call on you to ask. There is no guarantee that all questions will be addressed.
  - If question can wait until the end of the lesson, then post question in PollEverywhere and/or upvote relevant questions within PollEverywhere.

  - We will be using PollEverywhere to answer questions at the end of each lesson throughout the workshop. You can connect to our PollEverywhere questions at any time during the workshop at PollEv.com/hbctraining945.
  
#### Transitions between lessons and breaks

After each lesson, we will take a 5-10 minute break. The Presenter will inform you of the break.

###  Workshop follow up

If any questions come up after the workshop, then please email hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu.
