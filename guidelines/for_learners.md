These guidelines are for learners taking a hands-on workshop online

### Setting up prior to workshop

* ~They should use dual monitor if they have~
* Quit/minimize all applications that are not required for class
* Download all required packages and install all required applications
  * Email the HBC Training Team if any of the downloads/installations are problematic
* Check sound quality on laptop and use headphones if possible
* We will be using Zoom for the workshop
  * We will provide a URL that can be used to join the classroom/meeting with a web browser or with the Zoom app
  * A Zoom account is NOT needed to join the class

### Getting started

* Quit/minimize all applications that are not required for class
* Find the Chat window in Zoom
* Find the following button within the Chat sidebar
  * Raise hand
  * Check mark (equivalent to a green post-it) - "agree", "I'm ok"
  * Cross mark (equivalent to a red post-it) - "disagree", "I need help", "unsure"

### During workshop - Getting questions answered, troubleshooting, etc.

* Quit/minimize all applications that are not required for class

### [Learner] Follow up


### [Learner] Odds and ends
* Avoid opening too many apps. If zoom drops out in the middle, don't worry. Just restart and rejoin.
