## Online Bioinformatics Training
***Preparation instructions for online learning and teaching, with a focus on Bioinformatics.***

This repository contains detailed guidelines and instructions for both insturctors and learners joining online workshops with the [Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu). Some of these guidelines might be specifically for Zoom, but many of the concepts will be applicable for other platforms too.

* [Guidelines for instructors](guidelines/for_instructors.md)
* [Guidelines for learners](guidelines/for_learners.md)

***

We have also [created a list]() of Bioinformatics Trainings available online.

A few other resources created for this purposed are listed below, we have borrowed from some of these to create our guidelines.
 * For learners and Instructors:
    * From [@devbioinfoguy](https://github.com/devbioinfoguy) and [@hbc-rcs](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/) - [Remote learning](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/remote_learning)
    
 * For instructors:
    * From [@elliewix](https://github.com/elliewix) - [Tips for live teching tech online](https://elizabethwickes.com/2020/03/12/tips-for-live-teaching-tech-online-deeply-informed-by-the-carpentries/)
    * From [@carpentries](https://github.com/carpentries) - [Using Zoom for online trainings](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/guide/index.html#zoom)

*PS - We realize this is highlighting the redundancy in the information available out there, but our purpose was to generate specific instructions for our learners while also pooling resources.*
