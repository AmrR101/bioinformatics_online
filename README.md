## Online Bioinformatics Training
***Preparation instructions for online learning and teaching, with a focus on Bioinformatics.***

This repository contains detailed guidelines and instructions for both insturctors and learners joining online workshops with the [Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu). Some of these guidelines might be specifically for Zoom, but many of the concepts will be applicable for other platforms too.

* [Guidelines for instructors](guidelines/for_instructors.md)
* [Guidelines for learners](guidelines/for_learners.md)

We have also [created a list]() of Bioinformatics Trainings available online.

A few other resources created for this purposed are listed below, we have borrowed from a lot of these to create ours.

*PS - We realize this is highlighting the redundancy in the information available out there, but our purpose was to generate specific instructions for our learners while also pooling resources.*
